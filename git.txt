This is meant to be a reference guide when it comes to git. I will also
be including some information of GitHub since I will also be using that.

Initializing a local repository:
--navigate to directory
--use "git init" command

To grab repository online:
--Go to chosen directory and init
--use 'git clone'

This creates a new subdirectpry named .git that contains all necessary repository
files.  

You can then start adding files to track by using the "git add" command

--git add <filename>
--git add *.ext    -- adds all files with same extension

To check the status of tracked files in directory, use 'git status'.

This should show you which files are being tracked and what tracked files have been
modified.

git commit will commit the changes to the files in the stagin area

Discussion of checkout:

Since Im working on a lot of my repos alone. It doesn't seem that I'll be needing checkout because o
of this.  Instead, I'll be able to make changes to the local files, test them, stage them,
and commit them. 

If for some reason I mess up any of my files, I should be able to pull from the 
remote repo.

I could also branch off of the master to edit some of my files to add features, merge if 
they work and rollback if they mess up the code in some way.
